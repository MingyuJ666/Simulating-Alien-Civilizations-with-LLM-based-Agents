## Introduction
This study introduces "CosmoAgent", an innovative artificial intelligence system utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate complex interactions between human and extraterrestrial civilizations. This paper introduces a mathematical model for quantifying the level of civilization development and further adopts a state transition matrix approach to evaluate the trajectories of civilizations. Through this methodology, our study quantitatively analyzes the growth trajectories of civilizations, providing insights into future decision-making at pivotal growth and saturation junctures. Furthermore, the paper acknowledges the vast diversity in potential living conditions across the universe, which could foster unique cosmologies, ethical codes, and worldviews among various civilizations. Recognizing the Earth-centric bias inherent in current LLM designs, we propose the novel concept of using LLM agents with diverse ethical paradigms and simulating interactions between entities with distinct moral principles. This innovative research not only introduces a novel method for comprehending potential inter-civilizational dynamics but also holds practical value in assisting entities with divergent value systems to strategize, prevent conflicts, and engage in games under conditions of asymmetric information.
